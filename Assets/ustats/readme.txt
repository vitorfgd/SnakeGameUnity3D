A simple Editor Extension that shows the Project Statistics:
- Time spent editing the game
- Time spent testing the game

- Lines of C# Code
- Lines of JavaScript Code
- Lines of Boo Code

- Amount of Scripts
- Amount of Textures
- Amount of Sounds
- Amount of Videos
- Amount of Texts


Usage Guide:
- Go to Window->ustats to see the Project Statistics


Additional Information:
- The "Time Spent" statistics are project dependent, they remain even after
  changing the computer or after moving the project to a different folder.
  (This works by saving them in Library/ustats.data)
- The "Time Spent" statistics only increase while actually working in Unity.
  They won't increase while the window is inactive or minimized.
