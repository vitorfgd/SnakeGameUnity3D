supersnake!
===================

supersnake! is a quick project created for the "Introduction to game development" course. I tried to cover the basics of game creation such as engine (Unity3D) environment, basic programming, asset usage, game exporting, game feel, gamification, etc.

This course was presented during the "Semana Acadêmica dos Cursos de Informática" at Instituto Federal Catarinense.
