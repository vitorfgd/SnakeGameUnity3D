supersnake!
===================

supersnake! is a quick project created for the course "Introduction to Game Development". On this course, I tried to cover the basics of game creation such as engine (Unity3D) environment, basic programming, asset usage, game exporting, game feel, gamification, etc.

The course was presented during the "Semana Acadêmica dos Cursos de Informática" at Instituto Federal Catarinense.
