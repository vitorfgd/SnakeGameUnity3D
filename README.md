supersnake!
===================

**supersnake!** is a quick project created for the **"Introduction to Game Development" course**.

During the course, I tried to cover the basics of game creation such as:

- Engine (Unity3D) environment;
- Basic programming;
- Asset import, configurations and usage;
- Multiplatform exporting;
- Game feel;
- Gamification and other small aspects;

This course was presented during the *"Semana Acadêmica dos Cursos de Informática"* at *Instituto Federal Catarinense*.
